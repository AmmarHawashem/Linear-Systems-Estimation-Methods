# Linear-Systems-Estimation-Methods

If you're an enigneer, you probably have studied the gaussian elimination to solve linear systems. However, do you know that it becomes harder to apply when the size of a matrix becomes larger. This is why iterative methods were found, to estimate the solution of a linear system faster than gaussian elimination, especially with larger matrices.


In this case study,
We compared three iteratove methods which are:
1- Jacobi method
2- Gauss-Seidel
3- Successive Over Relaxation 

The comparison was between these three methods along with gaussiam elimination (when possible) in terms of:
- Number of iterations
- Time of execution (in google colab & Jupyter NB)
- Memory allocation

If you're excited to learn about the topic and interested in the findings, don't hesitate to view it.


Note: This was a group case study, my main work was to build code for the three methods and to write up an explanation of Guass-Seidel method

I would be grateful for any feedback and it is the real reason of¬†publishing¬†üôè
