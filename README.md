# Linear-Systems-Estimation-Methods

If you're an engineer, you probably have studied the gaussian elimination to solve linear systems. However, do you know that it becomes harder to apply when the size of a matrix becomes larger. This is why iterative methods were found, to estimate the solution of a linear system faster than gaussian elimination, especially with larger matrices.
In this case study, We compared three iterative methods which are:
- 1- Jacobi method
- 2- Gauss-Seidel
- 3- Successive Over Relaxation

The comparison was between these three methods along with gaussian elimination (when possible) in terms of:
- Number of iterations
- Time of execution (in google colab & Jupyter NB)
- Memory allocation

If you're excited to learn about the topic and interested in the findings, don't hesitate to view it.

Note: This was a group case study, my main work was to build the codes for the three methods and to write up an explanation of Gauss-Seidel method

I would be grateful for any feedback and it is the real reason for publishing üôè
